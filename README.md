# OSINT
A fully functional OSINT tool made using Python with APIs for a Cyber Security Technologies class at Illinois Tech.

As part of our ITMS 448/548 
### Project Description:
In this group assignment, you will collaboratively design, develop, and implement a custom open-source intelligent application in a high-level programming language such as Python. The application should feature a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI) and have the capability to retrieve and process data from at least four distinct data sources or APIs. You will be responsible for creating a comprehensive project plan, risk management plan, earned value sheet, and project management plan. Additionally, you will perform data analysis on the captured data and present your findings. All code developed should be hosted on GitHub for version control and collaborative development.

### Project Deliverables:
**Project Plan:** Create a detailed project plan outlining tasks, milestones, timelines, roles, and responsibilities. Include development phases, testing, and documentation.

**Risk Management Plan:** Identify potential risks that could impact the project's success. Develop strategies to mitigate, monitor, and respond to these risks.

**Earned Value Sheet:** Maintain an earned value sheet to track project progress, budget, and performance indicators.
**Project Management Plan:** Present an overall project management plan that includes communication strategies, team collaboration tools, and workflow guidelines.

**Intelligent Application with GUI:** Develop a fully functional open-source intelligent application with a user-friendly GUI. Ensure the application can retrieve and process data from at least four different data sources or APIs.

**Data Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive data analysis on the captured data using appropriate tools and techniques. Present your findings in a clear and insightful manner.

**GitHub Repository:** Maintain a version-controlled GitHub repository containing all code, documentation, and resources related to the project.
